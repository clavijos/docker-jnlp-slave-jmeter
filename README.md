# Jenkins JNLP Agent Docker image

This is an image for [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) agent (FKA "slave") using JNLP to establish connection.
This agent is powered by the [Jenkins Remoting library](https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting), which version is being taken from the base [Docker Agent](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-slave/) image.

See [Jenkins Distributed builds](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds) for more info.
